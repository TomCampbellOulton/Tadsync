Tadsync is an updated version of Natro Alt Synchronization by @aqts-aqts to allow new patterns and paths to be used in addition to the ability to disable Mondo looting.
Auto updates have been disabled due to the updates not working with the field following mechanic.
-- Works for paths requiring Natro Macro versions 1.0.0.3 and 1.0.1 --

-- How To Use: --
1. Install and unzip
2. Launch "Start.bat" file
3. Configure "Gather" tab according to preference
4. Update "Settings" tab to have correct movement speed, move method and sprinkler type
-- Field Following Ability --
5. On "Status" tab, click "Change Discord Settings" under "Discord Integration"
6. Click on the discord logo at top left of screen (should turn golden and now read "Discord Bot Settings")
7. Enable the bot and paste in the bot token
8. Close the bot settings and move to "Misc" tab on the macro
9. Under "Unofficial Extensions" click "Field Following"
10. Tick "Enabled" and select "Follow Mode" (Leader for the account to be followed, follower for the alt accounts/ accounts to follow)
11. Paste in the channel ID for the Discord channel used to sync the accounts (your bot MUST be in this server with following permissions: Attach Files, Embed Links, Read Message History, Send Messages, View Channels)
12. Enter the length of time (in SECONDS) for how long you wish to have your accounts stay in that field before returning to the individual's macro settings (will be overridden by a new summons by the Leader account, Mondo Chick, etc.)
13. Close the "Field Following" tab and press "Start (F1)"
